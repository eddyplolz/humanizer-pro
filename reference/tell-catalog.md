# Tell Catalog — full reference with before/after

The complete pattern library behind `SKILL.md`. Nine families. Each sub-tell lists its **watch-words**,
the **problem**, a **before → after**, and **source** (WP = Wikipedia "Signs of AI writing", PDF =
"Comprehensive Analysis of AI-Generated Writing Tells", SS = Stop Slop).

**Read this with the operating principles in mind** (see `SKILL.md`): hunt *clusters*, not single
words; don't over-correct legitimate prose; don't swap one template for another. For artifact tokens
and placeholder stubs, see `reference/llm-artifacts.md`.
